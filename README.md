# Black Jack Project in Python

Welcome to the Black Jack project in Python! This project is a simple implementation of the popular card game Black Jack, developed entirely in Python.

## Description

This project simulates a game of Black Jack where the player competes against the dealer. The goal of the game is to get a hand with a value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, and to surpass the dealer's hand value.

## Features

- Single-player game against the dealer.
- Basic Black Jack rules.
- Interactive text-based interface.
- Clean and modular code for easy understanding and extension.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x

Game Rules
Initial Deal: Two cards are dealt to the player and two to the dealer. One of the dealer's cards remains hidden until the end of the game.
Player's Turn: The player can choose to "Hit" (receive an additional card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).
Dealer's Turn: After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card and decides to "Hit" or "Stand" based on fixed rules (typically, the dealer hits on 16 or less and stands on 17 or more).
Determining the Winner:
If the player exceeds 21, they lose.
If the dealer exceeds 21, the player wins.
If neither exceeds 21, the hand with the higher value wins.
In case of a tie, the game is considered a draw.
